You will find below the code for all the analyses presented in the study of PaÃ«s et al, "Establishment of hindgut bacterial ecosystems and acquisition of microbial functions in the infant rabbit: impact of early-life nutrition and polysaccharides ingestion" 
Nomenclature: 
STA- or STAN: rabbits access to solid food enriched in starch from 15 days
STA+ or STAP: rabbits access to solid food enriched in starch from 3 days
RFF+ or RFFP: rabbits access to solid food enriched in rapidly fermentable fibres from 3 days

# Litters description

Description of the feeding behaviour and growth of the 48 rabbit litters studied

## Ingestion pattern

Herein we analyse feeding behaviour of the litters (one litter = 10 rabbits at the beginning of the experiment) before weaning. 

Rabbit milk consumption and solid food ingestion (first with gel food and then with pellets) are studied. In rabbit farming, the ingestion of solid food starts before weaning and becomes predominant in the fourth week after brith

### Milk consumption

The data analyzed were collected from d3 to d21 by weighing the doe before and after nursing

#### Import data and cleaning

Outliers are considered with the rule: mean+/-3*sd (because partial suckling could have accidently occured)


```r
milk<-read.table("Milk_consumption.csv", header=TRUE, sep=";", dec=",")
milk$AGE<-as.factor(milk$AGE)
milk$GROUP<-as.factor(milk$GROUP)
milk$FEMALE<-as.factor(as.character(milk$FEMALE))
milk$MILK_CONSUMED_RABBIT<-as.numeric(as.character(milk$MILK_CONSUMED_RABBIT))

#We delete negative values
milk<-milk[milk[,8]>0,]

#We look for outliers
boxplot(MILK_CONSUMED_RABBIT~AGE, data=milk, main="Original data")
```
